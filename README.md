# vigenere-cipher

The vigenere cipher is an encryption and decryption method that utilizes a key. It consists of the alphabet repeating for 26 rows/columns, but the first letter is pushed to the end of the alphabet, and this continues until z is the first letter in the 25th row. The program then uses the key for the rows and the message to be encrypted for the columns; the letters are matched up, and the encrypted message is displayed. Punctuation and spaces are untouched.
